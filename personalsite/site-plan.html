      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The aesthetic for the homepage will be themed by the early 2000’s. When I think about this time I think about bright colors, clear plastic electronics, and honestly a design that would be considered tacky by todays standards. In introducing what mattered to me and influenced me as a kid, I want to be true to the time. That being said I still want a level of cleanness to the presentation, because I want to make it easy to navigate from one page to the next. Fun, childlike, but still clean.

      </ul>
      <h3>Games and Toys</h3>
      <p>
        For this section of the website I want to back even further and go for an 80’s pixel art design. I to this day am into retro gaming and retro hardware. There is something about sprites in video games that come off as very clean despite being a very old form of rendering a game. The color scheme for this part of the website will also be based upon the colors of the Nintendo 64 logo. Each game I talk about will have an accompanying picture, and I’ll try to organize them my time period.

      </ul>
      <h3>Movies and TV</h3>
      <p>
        When I was young, I loved Spider-man, SpongeBob SquarePants, The Fairly Odd Parents, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Full House and MythBusters. With this in mind I want to design this page to be both colorful, and with a similar style to those 90’s paper cups. (Picture below related.) When I talk about a show or movie, I will talk about a scene or episode that really stood out to me and I got excited for. There will be a related picture for each show or movie
